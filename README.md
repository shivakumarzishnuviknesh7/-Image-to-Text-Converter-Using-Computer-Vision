This project aims to develop a web application that converts images into descriptive text captions using advanced computer vision techniques. Users can upload images through a user-friendly interface, and the app will generate and display corresponding textual descriptions. The application leverages powerful image captioning capabilities to transform visual content into meaningful text. This tool can be useful for various applications, including accessibility for visually impaired individuals and automatic image annotation. Built with Python and state-of-the-art machine learning models, this project demonstrates the integration of cutting-edge computer vision technology into practical applications.
